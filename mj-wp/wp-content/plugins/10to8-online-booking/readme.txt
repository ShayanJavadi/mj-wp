This creates the [10to8booking] tag to embed 10to8 into the page. Usage:
[10to8booking organisation_id="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"]

Once you've signed up for a free account at [10to8.com](https://10to8.com/?utm_source=wp_plugin&utm_medium=viral)
you will be given your organisation ID, a 30-character code, to paste into the [10to8booking] tag.
If you have an existing 10to8 account, you can find your ID by navigating to "Set Up > Buttons & Widgets" in the application 

We recommend adding the tag in text mode instead of visual mode to prevent other formatting of the URL being
inadvertently added. Support is available at http://support.10to8.com/
